# Tech Blog


## Description
The goal for this challenge was to build a CMS-style blog site from scratch similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
